# CSS Project

A stylish and modern CSS project featuring a sidebar navigation menu. The project is designed with a clean and attractive interface, making it visually appealing.

## Project Overview

The CSS project includes:

- **Responsive Design:** The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Sidebar Menu:** A sidebar navigation menu with smooth transitions and an elegant layout, providing easy access to different sections.

- **Hamburger Menu with Checkbox:** Instead of using JavaScript, the project utilizes a checkbox to control the functionality of the Hamburger menu. When checked, the sidebar extends; when unchecked, it goes back to the default position.
