# CSS-Sidebar
Here in this project only html and css is used to make a sidebar.
Usually javascript is included to control the functionality of the Hamburger menu but here the same logic is implemented using checkbox.
When checkbox is checked the sidebar gets extended and when it is unchecked sidebar goes back to the default position.
All the transitions, box-shadow and opacity are set to be changed whenever hovered over them.
