# CSS Project

A stylish and modern CSS project featuring a sidebar navigation menu. The project is designed with a clean and attractive interface, making it visually appealing.

## Project Overview

The CSS project includes:

- **Responsive Design:** The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Sidebar Menu:** A sidebar navigation menu with smooth transitions and an elegant layout, providing easy access to different sections.

- **Hamburger Menu with Checkbox:** Instead of using JavaScript, the project utilizes a checkbox to control the functionality of the Hamburger menu. When checked, the sidebar extends; when unchecked, it goes back to the default position.

- **Interactive Elements:** Transitions, box-shadow, and opacity change interactively when hovered over, enhancing the user experience.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the project.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the project, including the sidebar menu and other elements.
- `Camera-Img.jpg`: The background image used in the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Explore the stylish sidebar navigation and enjoy the responsive design.

## Style and Customization

- The project uses the 'Poppins' font from Google Fonts for a modern and clean typography style.
